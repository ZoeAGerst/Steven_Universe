    <h1>Lapis Lazuli</h1>
    <img src="LookBeckyItsLapis.png" width="264" height="302">
    <p>A former Homeworld Gem with a water drop-shaped lapis lazuli gemstone embedded 
    on her back and a blue color scheme who possesses extremely powerful hydrokinesis 
    that functions as her weapon or to form wings. Lapis got caught in the Gem war 
    while visiting Earth, mistaken for a Crystal Gem and becoming trapped in a mirror 
    designed to view her memories to be interrogated on Rose Quartz's whereabouts. 
    Lapis's mirror prison is then abandoned on Earth, her gemstone damaged from the 
    Homeworld Gems' exodus, and it was eventually found, later given to Steven, with 
    Lapis able to communicate with him and befriend him before having him release her. 
    Once freed, showing a vendetta against the Crystal Gems for keeping her in the 
    mirror, Lapis attempts to use Earth's oceans to construct a tower to reach 
    Homeworld, but Steven heals her cracked gemstone, allowing her to reform her wings 
    and simply fly back to her planet. However, later sending a warning to Steven, 
    Lapis finds herself captured by Yellow Diamond's forces and forced against her 
    will to serve as a reluctant Peridot's informant while leading her and Jasper to 
    the Crystal Gems, the event concluding when she fused with Jasper 
    to form Malachite in order to imprison Jasper in the ocean at the cost of her own 
    freedom. Lapis constantly tries to remain in control of Malachite in order to keep 
    Jasper imprisoned under the sea. When Jasper takes control of Malachite and breaks 
    themselves free before the fusion is undone by Alexandrite, with Lapis retrieved 
    while she is unconscious. Lapis decides to stay on Earth and at the barn while 
    eventually forgiving Peridot. The ordeal from being Malachite had a psychological 
    effect on Lapis to the point of disliking her own element and mixed feelings, 
    Steven managing to help her cope by taking her out to sea, and refuse Jasper's 
    offer for a re-fusion.</p>
