    <h1>Peridot</h1>

    <p>A former Homeworld Gem with a cranky, business-like demeanor. Her full name is 
    Peridot Facet-2F5L Cut-5XG, and she has a triangular peridot embedded on her 
    forehead. As a Peridot-type Gem, lacking the ability to shape-shift since she is 
    an Era-2 Gem, she is outfitted with "limb enhancers" to appear taller and defend 
    herself. The Crystal Gems see Peridot for the first time when she arrives to 
    observe the status of the Cluster and after she discovers their existence, she 
    travels to Earth with Jasper and Lapis Lazuli. However, it results with her being 
    marooned on Earth after she escapes through a pod as the ship crash-lands 
    onto Earth. Peridot makes attempts to contact her leader, Yellow Diamond, while 
    trying to keep a safe distance from the Crystal Gems. The Crystal Gems eventually 
    capture Peridot by sending her into her gemstone, which is bubbled and sent to the 
    temple, but she is later released by Steven so she can tell him about the Cluster 
    herself. She then decides to form a momentary alliance and a temporary ceasefire 
    with the Crystal Gems so they can together stop the Cluster. While still seeing 
    herself as a Homeworld Gem, Peridot ends up becoming an official member of the 
    Crystal Gems when she openly defies Yellow Diamond's order to keep the Cluster 
    active. Peridot chooses to remain at Steven's family barn while eventually earning 
    Lapis's trust.</p>
