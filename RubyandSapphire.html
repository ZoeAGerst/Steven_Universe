    <h1>Ruby and Sapphire</h1>
    <img  src="ruby_and_sapphire_ps_drawing_by_zoisitesarugaki-d8lp9yu.png" width="264" height="202">
    <p>Sapphire is an aristocratic seeress while Ruby is a foot soldier in Gem society 
    who served as one of Sapphire's three ruby bodyguards. When visiting Blue Diamond, 
    Sapphire predicted that the rebellion would end with her demise once two of her 
    rubies and four other Gems are defeated, but Ruby intervened before the former 
    part of the prophecy occurred and the two accidentally fused in the process. This 
    not only negates Sapphire's prophecy that Rose Quartz would be captured at that 
    moment, but the fusion itself is a violation of Gem culture with Ruby to be 
    executed for the act, though Sapphire saves her by getting themselves safely onto 
    Earth, where they form a romantic bond and consummate it by re-fusing into Garnet 
    indefinitely prior to joining the Crystal Gems. Ruby's gemstone is a ruby embedded 
    on her left hand, and Sapphire's gemstone is a blue sapphire embedded on her right 
    hand. Separately, having contrasting personalities, the two Gems have different 
    abilities which are utilized by Garnet: the hot-headed Ruby has thermokinsesis, 
    where she can generate heat, while using a small gauntlet as her weapon. The cool 
    and collective Sapphire, revealed to have a single eye under her bangs, has 
    cryokinesis, being able to freeze her surroundings and drastically decrease the 
    temperature around her, and the ability to use "future vision" to see possible 
    futures. She is also capable of sprinting at an unnatural speed as seen in their 
    escape from Blue Diamond as well as when they had escaped from Homeworld Gems 
    Peridot and Jasper with the help of Steven. Due to the strength of their love 
    maintaining their fused state, Garnet would rarely separate into Ruby and 
    Sapphire willingly.</p>
