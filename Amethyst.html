    <h1>Amethyst</h1>
    <img src="Jfek_New_Gen.png" width="264" height="319">
    <p>The second youngest member of the Crystal Gems, although she is still 
    thousands of years older than Steven. She has an amethyst embedded on her 
    chest, which she can use to summon an energy whip. Unlike the other Crystal 
    Gems, Amethyst was created on Earth as part of the Homeworld's Kindergarten 
    project to convert natural resources into a Gem-occupied world. While a quartz, 
    a Gem warrior caste are physically strong and use "spin attacks" on opponents, 
    Amethyst was not fully developed in size. Though taken into the team by Rose 
    Quartz when found, Amethyst possesses a rebellious and carefree personality and 
    a bit of a self-image crisis that played in her using her kind's shapeshifting 
    ability and notably eating more food & engaging in human activities more than 
    the other Crystal Gems, which furthers her and Steven's friendship. She also has 
    a mischievous sense of humour, and is often a source of comic relief.</p>
